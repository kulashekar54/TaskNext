# TaskNest â€“ A Jetpack Compose Modular To-Do App

Built to demonstrate native Android development using:
- **Jetpack Compose** for UI
- **Room DB** for local data
- **WorkManager** for background task sync
- **Hilt** for dependency injection
- **Modular project structure**
- MVVM + Unidirectional data flow

> Created as part of my journey to transition from cross-platform (Xamarin/.NET MAUI) to native Android with Kotlin.
